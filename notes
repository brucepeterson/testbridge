It is deceptivly simple, but there are considerations on 
the generalization of the card play.

In most card games the ranking may or may not be:
 - wild card (first played?) 
 - highest card of the trump suit (first played, eg Pinochle)
 - highest card of the led suit

Card comparisons, such as the trump suit (or lack thereof), led card, 
is dependent upon actions taken AFTER the creation of the card object.
Using the object __cmp__ function to find the highest card means that 
the actual function will have to bo overriden by actions at the table.
